# TakeNotesOnline

This application is an online application that will allow users to take notes on the go when there is no other word processor available. 
This application was made using the AngularJS framework. Users have the option of either downloading their notes or storing their notes online. The user interface for this application is straight forward. I had a lot of fun developing this small project, feel free to use!
